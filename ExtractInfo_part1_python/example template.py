-----------------------------------
The format of citing publications in a CV can vary depending on the style preferred by your field or employer. However, here is a common format for listing publications:

For journal articles:

Author(s). (Year). Title of article. Title of Journal, Volume(Issue), Page numbers.

Example:
Smith, J., & Doe, J. (2020). The impact of climate change on urban development. Journal of Urban Ecology, 15(3), 231-245.

For books:

Author(s). (Year). Title of book. Publisher.

Example:
Doe, J. (2019). Climate change and its effects. Oxford University Press.

For book chapters:

Author(s) of chapter. (Year). Title of chapter. In Editor(s), Title of book (pp. page numbers of chapter). Publisher.

Example:
Smith, J. (2018). Urban development in the 21st century. In J. Doe (Ed.), Perspectives on Modern Urban Development (pp. 130-145). Cambridge University Press.

For conference papers:

Author(s). (Year). Title of paper. In Name of Conference. Publisher.

Example:
Doe, J., & Smith, J. (2021). Addressing climate change in urban planning. In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Urban Planning and Development. IEEE.

Remember that all authors should be listed in the order they appear on the publication. If there are more than two authors, you may use et al. after the first author's name, depending on the citation style you're using. Also, titles of books and journals should be in italics.

These are general formats and might need to be adjusted based on the citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) preferred in your field. Always keep the citations consistent in style throughout your CV.
